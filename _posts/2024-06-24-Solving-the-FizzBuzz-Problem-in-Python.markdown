# Solving the FizzBuzz Problem in Python

If you're new to programming or looking to brush up on your coding skills, the FizzBuzz problem is a fantastic way to practice. In this post, we'll walk through solving the FizzBuzz problem using Python, a popular and beginner-friendly programming language.

## What is the FizzBuzz Problem?

The FizzBuzz problem is a common coding challenge that asks you to print numbers from 1 to a given number `n`. However, for multiples of three, you print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for the multiples of five, you print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five, you print "FizzBuzz".

### Example Output

For `n = 15`, the output should be:

```python
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz
```
Let's dive into the code. Here is a simple Python function to solve the FizzBuzz problem:

```python
def fizz_buzz(n):
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if i % 3 == 0 and i % 5 == 0:
            print("FizzBuzz")
        elif i % 3 == 0:
            print("Fizz")
        elif i % 5 == 0:
            print("Buzz")
        else:
            print(i)

# Test the function
fizz_buzz(15)
```

### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Looping through numbers**: The `for` loop iterates through numbers from 1 to `n`.
2. **Checking conditions**: 
    - If a number is divisible by both 3 and 5, it prints "FizzBuzz".
    - If a number is divisible by only 3, it prints "Fizz".
    - If a number is divisible by only 5, it prints "Buzz".
    - If none of the above conditions are met, it simply prints the number.

## Why FizzBuzz?

The FizzBuzz problem is often used in coding interviews to test a candidate's ability to write clean, logical code. It helps demonstrate understanding of loops, conditionals, and modulus operations in Python.

Solving the FizzBuzz problem is a great way to improve your Python skills. By practicing problems like this, you'll develop a stronger understanding of basic programming concepts and become more confident in your coding abilities.

Feel free to test the function with different values of `n` and see the results. Happy coding!
